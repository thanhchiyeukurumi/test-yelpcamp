This is just a trial version; the complete version will be finalized by mid-December. ~The finalization will also depend on my mood after completing the JLPT test in December 2024~. The updates will include:

- Improved code structure for better readability and maintainability.
- Enhanced user interface design.
- Option to display only the original map of Vietnam.
- Deployment on Heroku will be available in the near future.



FU*K, I'm cooked
